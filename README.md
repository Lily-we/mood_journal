# Mood-Based Recommendation App

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a tool that helps people improve their mood using personalized song and mini-story recommendations. Mental health is important, and small interventions can make a big difference.

## What it does
- Users submit their mood via a slider (from depressed to happy).
- The app records the mood and note.
- It immediately provides mood-based recommendations:
  - Songs to match or improve the mood
  - Mini-stories to calm, motivate, or entertain
- Helps users reflect on their feelings and feel better.

## Tech Stack
